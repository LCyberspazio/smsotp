# Shy Message System One Time Pad
by Giovanni @LCyberspazio Santostefano

The following document describes a protocol for a one time pad 
cipher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) that is usable 
without a computer or, at least a minimal use of technology.

As a weekend project I'm not responsible of any possible cipher 
breaking or any damage derived by reading and using informations of 
this document (do not read this while walking alone in a dark road).
